0,Connie,GB,"Nov 25, 2024","Overpriced products that have significantly dropped in qualityCoca-Cola is no longer carbonated enough and so goes flat when it's only been open a short amount of time. It's worse with the plastic bottles but still an issue with the cans. I used to drink a lot of Coke but now it always goes flat before I finish a bottle, or even a can. Lowering the quality but increasing the price to extortionate amounts is unethical and as the customer, you feel ripped off. Also the big bottles are now clearly made cheaply and are now flimsy, make them easier to spill when pouring, especially for people with motor issues. The new caps are a nightmare to get back on, again especially for disabled people but even for those without issues with their grip. Date of experience: November 25, 2024",1
1,Shelly J,US,6 days ago,"When Coca-Cola travels for business they‚Äôre too big for their britchesI used to enjoy their products, however I worked for a hotel and people from Coca-Cola came to stay for business. From walking in the door to departure, they were extremely rude including the vice president. They acted like they rented out the entire hotel instead of a few rooms. They felt entitled to request things get moved around in the communal areas multiple times and made a list for the general manager. For example, we had a Coca-Cola fridge (the hotel owns it) and they wanted us to change out the drinks displayed in there since they weren‚Äôt all Coca-Cola brand. They demanded we only hand out their branded water and have them in all the rooms during their stay (and not just their rooms. All of them!). The vice president also felt the need to violate our property rules. His assistant yelled at the security officer for doing their job asking him not to smoke his cigar in the courtyard (he insisted on doing this nightly). The next week we had a different soda brand come in for business and they did not act this way. They acted normal. Coca-Cola forgot that while they were there, they were acting under their brand. As a consumer, I have been vocal about their behavior and will support any other soda company. Date of experience is rough estimate. Date of experience: January 01, 2024",1
2,courtnee,AU,7 days ago,"Coca-ColaCoca-Cola, the world's most recognizable brand, is a prime example of how misleading marketing can mask a product's harmful effects. While it may offer a temporary burst of sweet satisfaction, the long-term consequences of its consumption are far from pleasant.Here's why you should think twice before reaching for that cold can of Coca-Cola:Sugar Bomb: A single can of Coca-Cola packs a shocking amount of added sugar, contributing to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease.Tooth Decay Nightmare: The high sugar content and acidic nature of Coca-Cola wreak havoc on your teeth, leading to cavities, erosion, and weakened enamel.Dehydration Danger: Despite its liquid form, Coca-Cola can actually dehydrate your body due to its diuretic effect.Empty Calories: Coca-Cola provides little to no nutritional value, leaving you feeling hungry and unsatisfied.Addiction Potential: The combination of sugar and caffeine in Coca-Cola can be addictive, making it difficult to break free from its grip.In conclusion, while Coca-Cola may be a nostalgic favorite for many, it's time to recognize its negative impact on our health. Opt for healthier alternatives like water, herbal tea, or fresh fruit juice to nourish your body and protect your future.Date of experience: September 11, 2024",1

63,John Hole,GB,"Mar 4, 2024","UK and EU sugar tax problem.Coke and cherry Coke are the only original products available in the UK that taste good as they don't contain sweeteners, I also used to drink pepsi but since PEPSICO sneakily changed the recipe by adding sweeteners to pepsi original I won't ever buy any again.What would be good is if Coco Cola would restore some of their other beverages back to the original without sweeteners such as Fanta I'd start buying it again.

You may like the product, or you might be staying away from it because of all the sugar and not-so-healthy and necessary things for your metabolism in the drink. but it is an inevitable fact that the coke is a household name in so many families across a vast majority of the countries in the world these days. It did not happen overnight obviously, but you know, it is like a tradition and a safe choice for a lot of people when it comes to soft drinks. I like to enjoy a light coke every now and then. It's that perfect combination of sweetness and the fizz that give you the tingling sensation when it goes down your throat.and It's not even the taste, it is about the adaptation, it is ""familiar"" so it has become like a comfort beverage for me. Especially with food when I now I cannot have any other beverage. It can also give you a short-time energy before the gym if you don't have access to a pre-work out at the moment, but don't take my word for it, i am not a personal trainer or a nutritionist haha :DDate of experience: January 26, 2024",4

So I contacted my office and they said you have to call the number on the machine. Long story short, this is a greedy, bad business. Told me they would NOT send a check for the money I lost, only a coupon to buy more!!! This pissed me off to say the least! Or, they said, I have to wait 48 hours or more for the delivery man who could give me my dollar. Well, I said, I can't wait all day here for him, I had been inconvenienced enough. This is very bad business for a customer who puts their money in the machine in good faith expecting to get what they paid for, but instead won't even give you your money back, THAT'S YOURS!!! I tell you now, I will NEVER purchase any kind of coca cola product again, furthermore I will NOT purchase anything from their sponsors their products, nor any company related with them ever again.

It snaps and doesn't allow you to close the bottle at all.  So wasteful. Sick of wasting money. So I just bought a soda stream. The bottle cap closes properly and if it's flat I can pop it in the carbonator and re fizz it. Also why are you still using PLASTIC when glass is better. Have the super markets charge a deposit , and we return them to the store. Like they do all over Europe.  With soda stream no more plastics!
